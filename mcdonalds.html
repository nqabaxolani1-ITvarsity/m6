    <p>KNOW OUR FOOD</p>
    <p>At McDonaldâ€™s we are confident about the quality of food we serve.
	You should be too. So join us as we go on a journey and discover where
	our food comes from and how it is made.</p>
	
     <p>McCain Foods make McDonald's French fries to our gold standard
	 specifications, which means that they are not quite the same McCain 
	 fries you find in the freezer section of your grocery store. Our cooking
	 process is also different from how you might cook fries at home. The reason
	 why our French fries don't break down or decompose when left out at room
	 temperature, is that once they are cooked, there is not enough moisture to
	 support bacterial or mould growth.</p>
	 
	 <p>All of the chicken in McDonald's Chicken McNuggets is "actual chicken".
	 They are made from chicken breast and a few seasonings, along with a natural 
	 proportion of chicken skin, used for both flavour and as a binder. The breast 
	 meat is removed from the bird and then mixed with seasoning prior to shaping
	 the Chicken McNuggets. The nuggets are then coated with a tempura-style batter.</p>
	 
	 <p>In South Africa, both chickens and cows are raised primarily on family farms.
	 We source our beef from independently owned cattle farms. Here, the cattle spend
	 most of their lives grazing in the feedlot. While feedlots for beef cattle may be 
	 looked at by some as an example of what they call "factory farming", a tour of one 
	 shows the animals have adequate feed, water and considerable room to move around.
	 We absolutely do not condone the cruel treatment of animals by our suppliers, and
	 we audit all abattoirs to ensure that their practices conform to our Animal Welfare
	 Guiding Principle. McDonald's South Africa (SA) are committed to transparency, so we 
	 do our very best to share the scientific facts and valuable opinions of independent
	 experts that guide our practices in regards to Animal Welfare.</p>
