                            <h3>COFFEE PLACE</h3>
    <p>If you want great coffee and tasty food on the go, you're at the right place!</p>
    <p>Pull in, have a breather and grab a real coffee. Choose from our
	great food range, be it breakfast, lunch or that all-important
	afternoon snack – we’ll have you back at your best and eating up
	the miles in minutes.</p>
	
     <p>Welcome to the invigoration station: espresso, latte, cappuccino or mocha –
	 we’ve got the lot and all of them are made with real beans and real skill.
	 Our Baristas use freshly ground Arabica beans to make the ideal cuppa. Arabica 
	 coffee beans deliver the perfect combination of sweetness, acidity and bitterness.
	 The high natural oil level per bean delivers aroma and a tactile experience –
	 a smooth feel with great body.  The Wild Bean Arabica blend consists of beans from
	 four countries – all adding a unique taste profile to our coffee: Tanzanian beans
	 from the Mbeya region give the blend its rich flavour, full body and high acidity. </p>
	 
	 <p>All our coffee, and we’re talking every single last bean, is sustainably and
	 ethically grown. Our beans are all UTZ certified – 100% sustainably sourced,
	 meaning you can take a reviving pit stop with a clear conscience.  Our farmers
	 are guaranteed a fair price for their crop, and the coffee we sell protects the 
	 growers and their fields. That means pickers and their families get support with 
	 things like education, health and housing – all that good stuff. Isn’t that refreshing? "</p>
